Hi there,

####Here's some notes about the development I've done: 

####Improvements I'd make on the code:
- Ideally there should be also a webpage generated from the code, to provide a much better UI. I found out that I can also provide a website after I've started implementing the code, so I didn't have time to rewrite the whole code using a framework such as [nestJS](https://nestjs.com/).
- I'd like to use a dependency injection framework (maybe the dependency injection of nestJS) 

#### Known issues
- If there is no traffic for the past interval an alert will not recover.
